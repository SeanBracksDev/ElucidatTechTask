1. Upon visiting the site and pressing the "START" button, the users current score is displayed incorrectly, it is instead todays date (month/day/year)
2. Upon selecting the first case "Making a case against Kevin", then clicking the "JUDGE THIS" button, and finally selecting either "Guilty" or "Not guilty" and then voting, the modal pop-up will suggest you selected the opposite option of what you actually selected.
    e.g if selecting "Guilty" and then voting, the modal suggests you voted "Not guilty".
3. Upon visiting the site and pressing the "START" button and selecting the second case "Who is to blame?", this navigates to the wrong case - case 1, as if the user had selected "Making a case against Kevin", instead of case 2.
