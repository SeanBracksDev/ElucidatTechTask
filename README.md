# Elucidat Technical Task

I've included both a `requirements.txt` file and poetry files `poetry.loc` & `pyproject.toml` as I don't know what dependency manager is going to be used.

Only tested on firefox because of time constraints, although the errors/bug I've noted are not browser specific.

I would have included screenshots with the descriptions of the bugs in the `bugs_observed.txt` file, but I ran out of time.
